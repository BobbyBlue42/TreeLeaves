# TreeLeaves
Xamarin-based app that uses Microsoft Custom Vision to determine the type of tree that a photographed leaf belongs to.

This app is heavily based on the tutorial provided by the NZMSA program [here](https://github.com/NZMSA/2017-Phase-1-Module-2), as it was created for this module.

The Custom Vision project used in this app has been trained on several pictures of different types of leaves. Currently supported types of leaves include:
	*Cherry
	*Chestnut
	*Maple
	*Oak
